_**Almost Human (2020-2021)**_ // add a link

Almost Human is an interactive short film written, directed and filmed by Alberto Scotti,
a long time collaborator from the University of Leeds. I was approached to record, edit
and mix the audio for the film, as well as to research commercial standards for audio quality and levels. Recording was done both on set with a boom mic (Shure VP82) and during post. Significant post-processing was applied to certain sections for noise reduction, and increasing speech clarity, mainly using the iZotope RX8 Educational Vocal Processing Suite. The nature of the project as one where the story forms a binary decision tree resulted in clear sections of film which fit together in different ways based on the user. It was fascinating to explore this within the context of the sound, as the objective became to make the transitions between sections work for a number of possible scenes, both technically and thematically.
