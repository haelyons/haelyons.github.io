_**Entropy Cleric (2020)**_

The Entropy Cleric is a synthesizer built in MaxMSP. Beyond oscillators, filters, portamento, envelope and other standard functionality, the Cleric features a generative music system which takes note toggle input from the 'Spicey™ Note Generation' tab in the top left, randomly selecting the next note to be played from those toggled along with adjustable interval range.



The name 'Entropy Cleric' refers to the decaying nature of the synth – if left on for an extended period (12 hours) the sound quality will
progressively decay, eventually descending into random noise.

The Cleric is available for free download on my Github under MaxMSP Experiments.
