_**Blue Space (2020)**_

Blue Space is a real-time Granulator, capable of recording any
audio input – whether live or sampled based – without artefacts
in the recording or playback, while outputting the granulated input,
a granulated version of the previous content (until the buffer loops),
or clean input (which can be simultaneous) each controlled by faders.

Granulation parameters include noise-based panning, grain duration,
transposition, random repositioning, envelope modification/randomisation
and MIDI control.
