          I am driven by curiosity and a desire to build, searching for innovative ways to implement tools taking advantage of my multidisciplinary training in signal processing and software development.
          Currently I am searching for opportunities to gain practical experience in the construction of robust systems with accessible, data-driven interfaces.

        <p>
          Graduate from the University of Leeds in BSc Music, Multimedia and Electronics (MME) I was delighted to explore a variety of Electrical Engineering disciplines such as C/C++ for microcontroller programming (Arm, FPGAs), filter design and signal processing in Matlab, as well as musical applications building instruments and synthesizers both digitally, and in hardware (MaxMSP, LTSpice, MultiSim).

          I am passionate about sustainability and environmental conservation, particularly in the area of underwater noise pollution due to its adverse effects on marine ecosystems and sensitive species. I believe in individual responsibility toward the collective, especially within the context of climate change, and strive to apply this to my daily life. In this vein, I think that new tools taking advantage of machine learning models can help us improve our practices and transition into a sustainable, circular economy.

          In my free time I play harp, explore artefacts in compression algorithms, compose music with Ableton Live and practice urban exploration. Over the course of 3rd Year (2020-2021) my personal projects included working on a short choice-based interactive film – Almost Human – and prototyping a live audio to haptic feedback device which would extend interaction with music for those with varying levels of hearing impairment – sknWaves.
