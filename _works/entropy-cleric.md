_**Entropy Cleric (2020)**_

The Entropy Cleric is a synthesizer built in MaxMSP. As a synthesizer it has a number of basic functions, generating a tone from an oscillator based on keyboard input, which is then passed through a filter, and a number of other effects. The full signal chain is detailed below.


Beyond these functions, the Cleric features a generative composition system, which takes input from the 'Spicey™ Note Generation' tab in
the top left, where notes are toggled to be added to an algorithm
which randomly determines the next note and intervals within a specified bound.

The name Entropy Cleric refers to the decaying nature of the synth – if left on for an extended period (12 hours) the sound quality will progressively decay, eventually descending into random noise.
