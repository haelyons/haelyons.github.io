Beyond oscillators, filters, portamento, envelope and other standard synthesizer functionality, the Entropy Cleric features a generative music system which takes note toggle input from the 'Spiceyâ„¢ Note Generation' tab in the top left, randomly selecting the next note to be played from those toggled along with adjustable interval range.
